# FunGuysCo_Twitch_Bot

This is a fun lil thing where we can play with the twitch api and create a bot. I will use PIPENV, and the twitch libraries to do so.
Any ideas are welcome. Mostly just trying to figure out and have fun.


Kieffer, look up PIPENV and make sure you understand virtual environments and you will be able to run this. Also, this is what I based this off of: https://dev.to/ninjabunny9000/let-s-make-a-twitch-bot-with-python-2nd8
